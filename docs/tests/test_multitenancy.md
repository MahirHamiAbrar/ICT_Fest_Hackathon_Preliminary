# `tests/test_multitenancy.py`

## Scope

- README rule 9 (**Multi-tenancy**): a user may only ever read or act on
  data belonging to their own org, on every code path; cross-org resource
  ids behave as non-existent (`404`).
- README rule 10 (**Booking visibility**): members read/cancel only their
  own bookings; admins read/cancel any booking in their org.

(Cancellation-specific ownership checks live in `test_cancellation.py`;
this file focuses on booking creation, `GET /bookings/{id}`, `GET
/bookings`, usage-report, and export.)

## Bugs caught

- **`GET /admin/export` leaks other orgs' bookings.**
  `app/services/export.py::generate_export`, when `include_all=True` and a
  `room_id` is supplied, calls `fetch_bookings_raw(db, room_id)` — which
  queries `Booking` by `room_id` alone, with **no** `Room.org_id == org_id`
  filter. An admin who guesses/enumerates another org's room id gets that
  room's full booking history. See `docs/app/services/export.md`.
- **Fixed: `GET /bookings/{id}` now enforces member ownership.**
  `app/routers/bookings.py::get_booking` now denies non-admin access when
  `booking.user_id != user.id`, returning `404 BOOKING_NOT_FOUND` as required.
- **`GET /bookings` pagination bug also breaks this file's assertion.**
  `test_list_bookings_only_returns_callers_own_bookings` fails not because
  of a _visibility_ leak (the query does correctly filter by
  `Booking.user_id == user.id`) but because of the pagination offset bug in
  the same handler (`.offset(page * limit)` skips the only booking that
  would otherwise be on page 1). See `docs/tests/test_pagination.md` and
  `docs/app/routers/bookings.md` for the actual bug; this test is a
  secondary symptom of it, not a distinct multi-tenancy bug.
